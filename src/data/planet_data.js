    justification: "Mars does not have birds. Liquid water cannot exist on the surface of Mars due to low atmospheric pressure, which is less than 1% that of Earth's except at the lowest elevations for short periods. Birds would not survive without water to drink. Also, due to lack of water, their are not bird baths on Mars, and birds love bird baths.",

    hasBirds: false,
    justification: "Jupiter does not have birds. Jupiter is the largest and most massive planet in our solar system. It has gravity about 2.5 times as strong as the gravity on our Earth. Gravity that strong would make it much too hard for birds to fly. Jupiter is also a gas giant, meaning it is made up entirely of gasses and has no true surface. If birds can't fly, but there is no real surface, then where does that leave them?!",

The only birds that like ice and could live on Uranus are penguins, but there are no penguins on Uranus, unfortunately.",
